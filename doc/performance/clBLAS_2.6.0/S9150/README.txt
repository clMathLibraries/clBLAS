# Sampling #
############
For each data point, we took 10 samples. Each sample consists of 10 gemm calls with a wait afterward. Outlying samples beyond 1 standard deviation were removed (rarely if ever did this actually need to happen). Before running the 10 samples, one warm-up sample was executed (but not included in the stastics).

GFlop/s was calculated as
(2*m*n*k flops) / (host time for 10 kernels / 10) // real data
(8*m*n*k flops) / (host time for 10 kernels / 10) // complex data
